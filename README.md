This repository contains my progress through the Version Control tasks.

## Tasks Completed:
- **I Can Win:** Basic setup, committing, and pushing.
- **Bring It On:** Branching, merging, and resolving conflicts in `arrows.txt`.
- **Hurt Me Plenty:** Created `storm` branch, used `git tag`, and practiced `git rebase`.
- **Nightmare:** Managed multiple remote repositories and switched URLs.
